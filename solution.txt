1. a)
   - CREATE .tar with simex archive
1. b)
   - pdf of linear / chain / stl  INSERT(FILL) and LOOKUP(FILL)

2. a) hand in main.cpp
   b) stats for cache misses : chaining  : 108 * 1e6
       	    	      	       linear    : 198 * 1e6
			       quadratic : 314 * 1e6
      It is expected that the quadratic table has more cache misses than the linear table, as the probes are spread further apart and will therefore produce more cache misses. 
   c) add quadratic to pdf from 1b)

3. a) hand in main.cpp
   b) pdf for unsuccesfull lookup -> WHERE DOES ROBIN HOOD OUTPERFORM LINEAR?

   The robin hood implementation outperforms the linear table for cache misses for all fill factors
   between 0.5 and 0.99.
      
      pdf for lost performance in original benchmark
